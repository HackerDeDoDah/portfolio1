                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of 45, after 24 years in the Plastic Injection Moulding Industry, I felt my life and career wasn't going in the way I expected. I have always been interested in coding and have tried to gain as much knowledge as i could with the limited time available to someone working a full time night shift and taking care of two boys with ADHD and a partner with disabilities. I wrote a children's book called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=10CLEAAAQBAJ">Luna</a>, which can be found on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=10CLEAAAQBAJ">Google Play Books</a>. I have tinkered with Arduino and Raspberry Pi and learned Ethical Hacking as a hobby. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="scheme.html">SCS Scheme at Netmatters</a> gave me the start I needed in coding HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.  I can design mockups in Balsamiq and design interactive and responsive layouts in HTML and CSS to the highest standard.</p>
